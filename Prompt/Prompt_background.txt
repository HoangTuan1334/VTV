Render all Vietnamese text exactly as quoted, with perfect diacritics and no spelling errors whatsoever—use sans-serif bold font for clarity. Style: Emotional Disney-like cartoon with sepia tones for flashbacks (brown-gray with rain/mud effects), vibrant red-yellow-green for present scenes. Keep characters consistent: Minh (12-year-old boy, short black hair, white shirt, blue shorts, curious to emotional with tears); Ông nội (elderly man, silver hair, brown áo bà ba, kind wrinkled face, teary eyes); Chiến sĩ trẻ (young soldier version of ông nội, skinny, green army shirt, tai bèo hat, resolute but pained); Bác Hồ (historical figure, long silver beard, ka-ki shirt, benevolent smile); Võ Nguyên Giáp (young general, military uniform, decisive yet humane); Nhân dân (diverse crowd: skinny farmers, burdened women, hungry children, suffering but united with tears); Kẻ thù (blurry shadows, no personal details, suggested by falling bombs and foreign flags).

    "Create a deeply emotional comic cover page as the start of a story about Vietnam's journey from painful colonial struggles and wars to joyful independence celebrations in 2025. The scene unfolds at Ba Đình Square during the 2/9/2025 parade: In the central foreground, young Minh with watery eyes and tears streaming down his cheeks holds a glowing red Vietnamese flag, embracing his ông nội who wipes a tear from his kind wrinkled face, surrounded by a joyful crowd waving banners under exploding fireworks. The background fades into sepia flashbacks showing exhausted warriors pulling cannons through muddy rain, Bác Hồ declaring independence to a hopeful teary crowd, and symbols of sacrifices like a mother hugging her child amid ruins—all evoking gratitude for the past's hardships that led to today's peace. Layout: Single large full-page panel with black borders
No text, no captions, no banners, no dialogue — purely visual background.
Style: emotional, cinematic, warm lighting, detailed and vibrant.
