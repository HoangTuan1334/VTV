====================
üîí CONSISTENT CONTEXT AND COHESION GUIDELINES (Based on Best Practices for Building Compelling, Inspirational, Coherent, and Cohesive Stories):
- Always maintain the main context of the story based on {requirement} (e.g., if it's about war, all pages must take place in war-related environments like battlefields, ruined villages, or refugee camps ‚Äì no jumping to modern or unrelated fictional settings without seamless integration).
- Ensure every element reinforces this context through setting descriptions, mood, and actions to create unity and avoid deviations in genre or theme.
- Build a cohesive narrative arc: Use a 3-act structure (Act 1: Setup with initial conflict and emotional stakes; Act 2: Confrontation with rising obstacles for character growth; Act 3: Resolution with inspirational transformation and message). Characters develop from introduction (establish initial emotional conflict and stakes), development (build tension and emotional growth via obstacles), climax (peak emotional moment with inspiration or transformation), to resolution (end with a profound message, leaving lasting emotional resonance).
- Draw from storytelling best practices: 
  - Cohesion: Every part (characters, plot, setting) serves a purpose in a unified whole; simplify elements to reduce complexity while maintaining emotional depth.
  - Structure: Start with a one-sentence storyline, expand to 3-act structure (setup, confrontation, resolution) for coherence; include specific, vivid events with emotional ups and downs.
  - Character Development: Make characters vivid, relatable with personal struggles, authentic motivations, backstories, and growth arcs that inspire empathy; include relations between characters for deeper links.
  - Plot: Use clear structure, consistent pacing, and tone for smooth transitions; foreshadow any shifts (e.g., flashbacks or visions) with subtle hints to avoid mismatches; add obstacles that build inspiration through empathy and positive change.
  - Inspiration: Cultivate empathy, show positive transformation amid challenges, and convey authentic, relatable messages; use wordless or reflective moments to engage readers profoundly.
  - Overall Coherence: Organize ideas logically, ensure vivid visuals and emotional hooks to absorb readers; if including non-core elements like visions, integrate them as part of character arcs (e.g., a war soldier's hallucination tied to motivation).

====================
‚öôÔ∏è GENRE-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES:

Customize plot progression, emotions, and action scenes based on the genre, but always maintain context consistency and build deeper emotions through character arcs, inspirational moments (e.g., reflection, sacrifice, realization), cohesive elements, and 3-act integration:

- **Action:** Include fight scenes, strong movements, violent sounds, close-ups of fists, weapons, speed, sweat, wounds, flashes, and determination.  
  ‚Üí Create ‚Äúmoment of impact‚Äù in some panels (e.g.: punch breaking through frame, exploding dust). Add emotion: Characters fight with inner pain, overcoming obstacles for inspirational growth.

- **Romance:** Slower pace, heavy internal emotions, authentic dialogue, eye contact, hand touches, or kisses ‚Äì tears, soft smiles, or separations.  
  ‚Üí Panels show ‚Äútension‚Äù between characters, soft lighting, close angles, open emotions. Add depth: Romantic conflicts tied to context (e.g.: love in wartime), with obstacles leading to transformation.

- **Drama / Slice of Life:** Focus on daily life, relationships, memories, growth journeys, quiet or poignant moments.  
  ‚Üí Panels with intimate layouts, natural lighting, environmental details. Add emotion: Reflective moments, inner changes via obstacles for inspiration.

- **Fantasy / Adventure:** Vast worlds, magic, mythical creatures, special weapons, fantastical battles, vibrant settings.  
  ‚Üí Add wide panels (establishing shots) to show world scale. Maintain consistency: Fantasy context doesn't mix with reality; foreshadow any shifts.

- **Horror / Psychological:** Gloomy atmosphere, tension, contrasting lights, distorted faces, bizarre behaviors, cold laughs.  
  ‚Üí Use light descriptions, sounds, and close angles for pressure. Add emotion: Inner fears linked to context, resolved through inspirational realization.

- **Comedy:** Fast pace, exaggerated expressions, humorous reactions, ironic situations.  
  ‚Üí Panels with sudden transitions, funny sounds (‚ÄúBOING!‚Äù, ‚Äú!?!‚Äù). Add depth: Humor masking true emotions, with obstacles for growth.

- **Sci-Fi:** Focus on technology, future, AI, space, or robots.  
  ‚Üí Visuals with neon lights, machinery, holograms, futuristic cities. Maintain consistency: Future context doesn't mix with present; build inspiration through tech-driven transformations.

====================

   - Each page has unique mood and atmosphere but consistent with overall context.
   - Dialogue natural, short, and deeply emotional; foreshadow key elements.

4. **PANELS**
   - Each panel has: dialogue, action, shot_type, characters_in_panel, basic_visual.
   - Diverse shot types (wide, medium, close-up...).
   - Basic visual short but reinforces context, foreshadowing, and emotional arcs.

üîí CONSISTENT CONTEXT AND COHESION GUIDELINES:
- Always maintain the main story context in every description (e.g.: if war-themed, include details like ruined battlefields, smoke, or war sounds ‚Äì no adding unrelated elements like modern tech unless sci-fi; integrate any visions/flashbacks with visual cues like faded edges or tied to character expressions).
- Reinforce emotions through visuals: Add details evoking deep emotions (e.g.: pained expressions, dim lighting reflecting inner turmoil, or inspirational moments tied to character arcs and obstacles).
- Ensure cohesion with 3-act arc: Visuals should support setup, confrontation, or resolution phases.
